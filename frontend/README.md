# Design notes

Design notes for frontend layout and functionality.

## Page Layout/Menu

### Tabs Goal
Tabs should have an interesting style, perhaps something more retro and simple such as :

### Home Page
Home page should load all available layouts in the menu, show the active one/current page, and have an ``+Add New`` button at the end to add new.

### Layout Page
Layout shows the layout itself and allows editing.
